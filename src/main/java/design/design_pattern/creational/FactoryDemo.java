/**
 * Factory pattern:
 * Create object without exposing the creation logic to client
 * Client use the same common interface to create new type of object
 *
 * Specifically, VehicleFactory provides client with method to create Vehicle based on given vehicle type
 * The library is now responsible to decide which object type to create based on an input.
 * Client just needs to make call to libraryâ€™s factory Create method and pass the type it wants without worrying about
 * the actual implementation of creation of objects.
