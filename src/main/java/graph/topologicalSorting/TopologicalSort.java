/**

 *
 * Topological sorting for a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed
 * edge uv, vertex u comes before v in the ordering. Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not
 * a DAG.
 *
 * Topological Sorting is mainly used for scheduling jobs from the given dependencies among jobs. In computer science,
 * applications of this type arise in instruction scheduling, ordering of formula cell evaluation when recomputing
 * formula values in spreadsheets, logic synthesis, determining the order of compilation tasks to perform in makefiles,
 * data serialization, and resolving symbol dependencies in linkers
 *
 * We can modify DFS to find Topological Sorting of a graph. In DFS, we start from a vertex, we first print it and then
 * recursively call DFS for its adjacent vertices. In topological sorting, we use a temporary stack. We donâ€™t print the
 * vertex immediately, we first recursively call topological sorting for all its adjacent vertices, then push it to a
 * stack. Finally, print contents of stack. Note that a vertex is pushed to stack only when all of its adjacent vertices
 * (and their adjacent vertices and so on) are already in stack.
