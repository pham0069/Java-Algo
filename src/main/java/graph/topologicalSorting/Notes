Topological sorting is only applicable to Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
It is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge uv, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.
Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.

We can modify DFS to find Topological Sorting of a graph. In DFS, we start from a vertex, we first print it and then
recursively call DFS for its adjacent vertices. In topological sorting, we use a temporary stack. We donâ€™t print the
vertex immediately, we first recursively call topological sorting for all its adjacent vertices, then push it to a stack.
Finally, print contents of stack. Note that a vertex is pushed to stack only when all of its adjacent vertices (and
their adjacent vertices and so on) are already in stack.
