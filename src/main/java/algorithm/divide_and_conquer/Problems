Find if array has an element whose value is half of array sum
* Problem:
Given a sorted array (with unique entries), we have to find whether there exist an element(say X) which is exactly half
the sum of all the elements of the array including X.

* Examples:

Input : A = {1, 2, 3}
Output : YES
Sum of all the elements is 6 = 3*2;

Input : A = {2, 4}
Output : NO
Sum of all the elements is 6, and 3 is not present in the array.

* Solution:
- Calculate the array sum by traversing
- If array is sorted, use binary search to find if the half value of sum exists in array
- If array is not sorted, an efficient way is to use hash set
- If array is sorted and non-negative, it is equivalent to check if the last element is half value of sum

Find an element in array such that sum of left array is equal to sum of right array

* Problem:
Given, an array of size n. Find an element which divides the array in two sub-arrays with equal sum.

* Examples:

Input : 1 4 2 5
Output : 2
Explanation : If 2 is the partition, subarrays are : {1, 4} and {5}

Input : 2 3 4 1 4 5
Output : 1
Explanation : If 1 is the partition, subarrays are : {2, 3, 4} and {4, 5}

* Solution:
