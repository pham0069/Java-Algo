/**
 * https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/task-scheduling/problem
 *
 * You have a long list of tasks that you need to do today.
 * To accomplish task i you need M_i minutes, and the deadline for this task is D_i.
 * You need not complete a task at a stretch.
 * You can complete a part of it, switch to another task, and then switch back.
 *
 * You've realized that it might not be possible to complete all the tasks by their deadline.
 * So you decide to do them in such a manner that the maximum amount
 * by which a task's completion time overshoots its deadline is minimized.
 *
 * Constraints
 * 1 <= T <= 10^5
 * 1 <= D_i <= 10^5
 * 1 <= M_i <= 10^5
 *
