/**
 * Basic Euclidean algorithm is used to get the GCD of two integer numbers
 * Extended Euclidean algorithm can resolve the solutions (x, y) to the following problem
 * ax + by = c
 *
 * Denote g = gcd(a, b). g|a and g|b --> g | (ax+by)
 * If c cannot divide g, there is no solution
 *
 * If c = m*g
