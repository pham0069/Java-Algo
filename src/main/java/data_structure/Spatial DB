1. Pin code (India) / Zip code (USA)
- e.g. 400050
    4      0           0           0    5               0
    zone    subzone     headoffice      postoffice

- Assign every location in the country with an id,
that can be attached to a post office

- Problem:
Start 400050, destination 400051, distance is small
but maybe there's a railway station btw these 2 locations
-> actual travelling distance is larger

2. Requirements of location-based DB

- measurable distance
+ uniform assignment (assigning id to every location)
+ scalable granularity (able to break a region into smaller size)

- proximity
(nearest neighbor search/ range search)

3. How to present a location ?

- coordinate (latitude, longitude)
+ convenient for measuring distance
+ proximity check: O(N^2) if we check for all points in DB
