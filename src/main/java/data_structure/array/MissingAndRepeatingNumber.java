/**
 * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-a-repeating-and-a-missing-number/
 *
 * Some methods
 * 1. Sort. Then traverse to see which element missing, which repeats
 * 2. Use value as index of array to mark count of the element
 * 3. Use map to check if element has appeared, element is not existent
 * Third method can use even if elements are not contiguous from 0 to 999
