I. Binary heap

1. Introduction
A Binary Heap is a Binary Tree with following properties.
- Itâ€™s a complete tree
(All levels are completely filled except possibly the last level
and the last level has all keys as left as possible).
-> This property of Binary Heap makes them suitable to be stored in an array.

- A Binary Heap is either Min Heap or Max Heap.
In a Min Binary Heap, the key at root must be minimum among all keys present in Binary Heap.
The same property must be recursively true for all nodes in Binary Tree.
Max Binary Heap is similar to MinHeap.

2. Example

        10                       10
       /  \                    /    \
      20   100                15    30
     /                      /  \    /  \
    30                     40  50  100  40

3. Presentation
- Similar to segment tree, it can represented in array
- Root is arr[0]
- for node arr[i], left child = 2*i+1, right child = 2*i+2
          1(0)
       /       \
      3(1)     6(2)
     /  \      /
   5(3) 9(4)  8(5)
