/**
 * Given a text txt of length n and a pattern pat of length m.
 * Print all occurrences of pat in txt. You may assume that n > m.
 *
 * As discussed in the previous post, we discussed that there are two ways efficiently solve the above problem.

 1) Preprocess Pattern: KMP Algorithm, Rabin Karp Algorithm, Finite Automata, Boyer Moore Algorithm.

 2) Preprocess Text: Suffix Tree

 The best possible time complexity achieved by first (preprocssing pattern) is O(n) and by second (preprocessing text) is O(m) where m and n are lengths of pattern and text respectively.
